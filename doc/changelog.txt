0.15.8
Dragon 2 Update
Variant group has been completely done from scratch. Dragons are now separeted based on their type.

Added:
- ET25-001
- ET25-002 (Graphics from ET26)
- ET25-003
- ET43
- ET43-001
- ET43-007

- E6ACTab, E6ACTadnb (Olavion)
- E6ACTadnb-071
- E6ACTadnb-073

Some of the vehicles have the same livery but different types. This is because some of them have last-mile diesel engine (letter "d" in their name).
Graphics were updated to make them drive on non-catenary tracks (pantographs are lowered) and names are now in light blue color (multifuncional).

Now purchase cost, running cost and halted cost depends on their type.
From cheapest to the most expensive:
- ET25, E6ACTa, E6ACTab
- ET26, E6ACTadb, E6ACTadnb
- ET43, E6MST

Fixed:
- EN90 sprites
- EN71-AKS sprites
